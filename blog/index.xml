      <description>openessence.io, why ? There are 3 key reasons why openessence.io exists as a project:
 To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are as interested in the approach as much as they are in the product; they want to reproduce things. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation To provoke discussion on ways of working and culture within a technology organisation, partly to discuss whether a practice library is a viable approach in a technical organisation.</description>

      <description>Virtual hackathon The very first openessence.io hackathon will take place during 27/28th June 2018 with the aim of creating a range of content for the openessence.io practice library. This will be a range of activities and techniques that are used when working with open source software and projects.
The aim of this first hackathon is to neatly capture what we do as a series of activities and techniques, so that they can then be catalogued and reviewed as the first part of the openessence.</description>
