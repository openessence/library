      <description>openessence.io, why ? There are 3 key reasons why openessence.io has been set up as a project:
 To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are now as interested in the approach as much as they are in the technology; they want to reproduce things so that they transform processes and culture. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation.</description>
