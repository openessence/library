      <description>openessence.io, why ? There are 3 key reasons why openessence.io exists as a project:
 To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are as interested in the approach as much as they are in the product; they want to reproduce things. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation To provoke discussion on ways of working and culture within a technology organisation, partly to discuss whether a practice library is a viable approach in a technical organisation.</description>
