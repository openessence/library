      <description>What is Context Switching? Context Switching can be described as multi-tasking which is often seen as a good thing. Unfortunately, we are not able to generate the same amount of output/value when we multi-task.
Much recent neuroscience research tells us that the brain doesnâ€™t really do tasks simultaneously, as we thought (hoped) it might. In fact, we just switch tasks quickly. Each time we move from hearing music to writing a text or talking to someone, there is a stop/start process that goes on in the brain.</description>
