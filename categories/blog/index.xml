      <description>Virtual hackathon The very first openessence.io hackathon will take place during 27/28th June 2018 with the aim of creating a range of content for the openessence.io practice library. This will be a range of activities and techniques that are used when working with open source software and projects.
The aim of this first hackathon is to neatly capture what we do as a series of activities and techniques, so that they can then be catalogued and reviewed as the first part of the openessence.</description>

      <description>openessence.io, why ? There are 3 key reasons why openessence.io has been set up as a project:
 To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are now as interested in the approach as much as they are in the technology; they want to reproduce things so that they transform processes and culture. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation.</description>
