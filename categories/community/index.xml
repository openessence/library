 A list of requirements A High Level Design document A Low Level Design document A task backlog  The outputs can then be fed to an implementation team who should be able to implement a solution that meets the requirements.</description>

      <description>What is Content Switching? Context Switching can be described as multi-tasking which is often seen as a good thing. Unfortunately, we are not able to generate the same amount of output/value when we multi-task.
Much recent neuroscience research tells us that the brain doesnâ€™t really do tasks simultaneously, as we thought (hoped) it might. In fact, we just switch tasks quickly. Each time we move from hearing music to writing a text or talking to someone, there is a stop/start process that goes on in the brain.</description>

      <description>What is Design Thinking? Design Thinking was originally developed as a process for creative designers but has wider business and social applications.
Why use it? It is a positive, creative approach for the initial parts of solution development. It is a good way of getting fresh, new ideas into an existing organisation. Thinking outside of the box is one way of describing it.
Related Practices It can be used as part of a Discovery Session or as part of a wider development project.</description>
