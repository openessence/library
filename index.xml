      <description>What is a Client Preparation Document It&amp;rsquo;s a document that maps out the prerequisites for a Discovery Session or other presales workshop. It ensures that all the key elements needed are actually in place prior to the meeting taking place.
The Document should be sourced around a particular theme, then edited to reflect customer details and passed on to the customer. It should outline a framework agenda for discussion and finalisation in the Pre-Call as well as potential outcomes from the one day Discovery Session.</description>

      <description>What is Context Switching? Context Switching can be described as multi-tasking which is often seen as a good thing. Unfortunately, we are not able to generate the same amount of output/value when we multi-task.
Much recent neuroscience research tells us that the brain doesnâ€™t really do tasks simultaneously, as we thought (hoped) it might. In fact, we just switch tasks quickly. Each time we move from hearing music to writing a text or talking to someone, there is a stop/start process that goes on in the brain.</description>

      <description>Virtual hackathon The very first openessence.io hackathon will take place during 27/28th June 2018 with the aim of creating a range of content for the openessence.io practice library. This will be a range of activities and techniques that are used when working with open source software and projects.
The aim of this first hackathon is to neatly capture what we do as a series of activities and techniques, so that they can then be catalogued and reviewed as the first part of the openessence.</description>

      <guid>https://openessence.github.io/blog/aims-objectives/</guid>
      <description>openessence.io, why ? There are 3 key reasons why openessence.io has been set up as a project:
 To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are now as interested in the approach as much as they are in the technology; they want to reproduce things so that they transform processes and culture. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation.</description>

      <description>What is the Schneider Model? The Schneider cultural model isn&amp;rsquo;t a new approach (it has its origins in the mid 90&amp;rsquo;s) but it&amp;rsquo;s relevant today. When applying technical and process changes as part of a transformation, this activity provides the means of assessing the current culture and how effective these changes may be.
The Schneider Model identifies the primary, underlying culture which shapes the organisation. There are 4 main types: - Control - Cultivation - Collaboration - Competence</description>

      <description>What is Design Thinking? Design Thinking was originally developed as a process for creative designers but has wider business and social applications.
Why use it? It is a positive, creative approach for the initial parts of solution development. It is a good way of getting fresh, new ideas into an existing organisation. Thinking outside of the box is one way of describing it.
Related Practices It can be used as part of a Discovery Session or as part of a wider development project.</description>

      <description>What is Pathfinder? Pathfinder is a web based application assessment tool which is used by customers to determine which applications could be containerised, the effort involved and any impediments to the containerisation process.
Pathfinder enables customers to view the order in which applications should be migrated as well as help determine the type of work involved e.g migrate, modernise etc, and a course estimate of the effort required.
